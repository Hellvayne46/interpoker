-- Inspired Programming Test Preparation --

This is a simple Node.js project which makes sure your computer has the necessary software installed in order to complete the Inspired programming
test. If you are an experienced Javascript developer it is highly likely you are already familiar with the below process, but read it anyway to
ensure you have not missed anything.

You need to install Node.js if you don't have it already. See https://nodejs.org/en/download/ and follow the instructions there. Any version over
6.0.0 should work, but we recommend you install the latest LTS version.

Once that is installed, you need to open a command window. On windows, open the folder where this project is unzipped. Hold SHIFT and right-click on a blank
space in that window. Click the "Open command window here" menu option.

In the command window, type

npm install

and wait to complete (Internet connection required). You can then run

npm test

to execute the tests. You should see something like:

Success!
  âˆš Run test

  1 passing (7ms)

You will be required to execute the same commands on the programming test project once you receive it.

If you encounter any problems with the above please message your contact at Inspired and copy and paste any errors you encounter.

Good luck!
